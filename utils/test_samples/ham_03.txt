Hi Amelia,
 
As you might remember from a past lesson, our principal bassoonist is out this week (rehearsals are Tuesdays), and our director is asking for a sub.  I was wondering, if I were to provide transportation (our rehearsal is in Hopkinton), would you consider subbing on first and it being a paid lesson for me?  I kind of like the idea, and I’m behind in lessons anyway.  $120 for the 2 hours of rehearsal (7.30 – 9.30) and a stipend for travel time?  I’ll also forward you the rehearsal notice for tomorrow.  The music this cycle is easy, and you’ve seen at least the 2nd part for all except the Faust.
 
If Jean is out next week too (I think she is but I will have to confirm), would you be able to do this next week too (barring any snow storms)?
 
Thanks, Jenny
