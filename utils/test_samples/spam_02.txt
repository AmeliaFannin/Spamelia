 Patrick Murphy for Congress

Amelia --

You have to believe us when we tell you that there’s already a lot at stake this year. 

The Tea Party-led Congress has doubled-down on their do-nothing agenda and the Koch brothers are planning to spend obscene amounts of money to target Democrats, like Patrick, who are fighting for the issues we believe in.

As one of Patrick's top supporters, we had to come to you right away. The road to 2016 starts now, which is why we have to nail our first end-of-month deadline. Are you on board?

Email: ameliafannin@gmail.com
January Budget Deadline: 11:59:59 PM 
Suggested Matched Donation: $3

We have to show the GOP that we’re united behind Patrick early this cycle. The best way to do that is to make sure we hit this deadline at midnight. Remember -- your donation will be matched dollar-for-dollar!

Thanks,

Team Murphy
